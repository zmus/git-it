Awarness of risks + Protection = Security

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malicious software
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Email spam**

**Spyware**
  * logging keystrokes 
  * stealing passwords or credit card numbers...
   
**Sending web requests**
  * click fraud 
      * to up views
  * DOS attacks ("denial of service") 
      * to keep people from being able to access websites
       
**Scanning for vulnerabilities** on other computers

**Data crunching**
  * crack password, mining for bitcoins...
   
**Backdoor** for future access
  * probably the most common
  * **Botnets**
      = zombie computers
      * hundred-thousands to millions
      * uses: theft, spam, sabotage, political actions...
      * can get your server flagged, public embarrassment, costs money, theft
      * when breached, even if nothing is stolen, customers must get new credit cards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hackers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**White hat** 
  = tries to find security problems

**Black hat**
  = uses web server in a way you did not intend
  * picking cool user name to stealing data from database
  * categories:
      * curious users 
      * thrill seekers
      * trophy hunters - most skillful
      * script kiddies - use elses scripts
      * political activists
      * professionals - make money from hacking

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**zero-day exploits**
  = security vulnerabilities known only to hackers
  * kept secret and traded
  * developer has had 'zero days' of awareness

Level of security is defined by the weakest link.
Having coverage of more area at the expense of weakness in areas that matter 
most is a bad tradeoff.

* Execute well the security you really need!
* Write software tests for common security concerns.
* Write a security policy (guide).
