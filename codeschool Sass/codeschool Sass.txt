> SCSS and Sass (not SASS)

> Two syntaxes:

  > .scss - fully CSS compliant - just rename .css to .scss :-) 

  > .sass - Ruby/Python like - uses indentations
  

> We should use:

  > @mixin + @include 

      => SIMILAR sets of properties used multiple times with small variations

  > @extend 

      => Sets of properties that match EXACTLY

  > @function 

      => Commonly-used operations to determine VALUES
