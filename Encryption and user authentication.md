 Encryption and user authentication
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Password encryption
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Never store passwords in plain text**
  * Compromises users on your site and on other sites

**Encrypt passwords with hashing algorithm** 

**One-way encryption**
  * = non-reversible, even by us
  * Same inputs + same hashing algorithm = same output
  * Actual password gets encrypted, then stored
  * Encrypt attempted password, compare against stored

Not all hashing algorithms are suitable for passwords
  * one-way
  * sufficiently strong 
  * --MD5-- not considered safe anymore - see 'rainbow tables'
  * SHA-1
  * SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512)
  * Tiger
  * AES
  * **Blowfish**
    * very secure
    * free - 
    * easy to install and work with
    * slow - desired for hashing because of brute force / dictionary attacks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Salting passwords
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rainbow tables**
  * = Pre-computed tables of password hashes for each hashing algorithm

**Salt**
  * = Additional data added to the password before encryption
  * Knowing password requires also *knowing the salt string*
    ```
    "Put salt on the {$password}"
    "e737f991346ba46a123678ee900d0e636e68e860f"
    ```
  * Rainbow tables would be almost impossibly large

**Unique salt**
  * = Create salt using strings *unique to each user*
  * Knowing password requires *knowing salt and username*
    ```
    "Put salt on the {$password} for {$username}"
    "aef6603ed62eb1u30fd5305ac6e8ad50a55d111de"
    ```

**Random salt**
  * = Create salt using pseudo-random string
  * Knowing password requires *knowing the random string*
    ```
    "Put salt on the {$password} at" . time() 
    "b137f51092926eaeffa294af0dab49ec726e1ccef"
    ```
  * Rainbow tables are useless - each user's hash is almost random / unique

**Store salt in database** 
  * When using user data for salt and it could change
  * When using random salt
  * Just the salt, not the plain text password
  * Hash the salt 

Blowfish 
  * uses a random salt 
  * stores it in a database in front of password as a single encrypted string:
    "hashed salt" + "hashed password"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Password requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Require length, but do not limit length**
  * longer = stronger
  * After hashing, encrypted strings are always of the same length 

**Require non-alphanumeric characters**
  * Rainbow tables have to be much larger 

**Ask users to confirm password**
  * Reduces the chance of mistakes which might lead to security lapses

**Report password strength to users**
  * use library

**Do not record a password hint**
  * some users will simply type their password, and then it is available in
    plain text to anyone trying to break in

**Security questins are questionable**
  * answers can be googled
  * hacker might be someone who knows you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brute-force attacks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also known as "Exhaustive key search"

rainbow tables = we know hashed password
brute force    = we go to the website and try every single possibility

Dictionary attack
  * try to use words in the dictionary first
  * idea is that words in dictionary are used before random characters

Key space ^ Key length  x  Time per attempt  =  Maximum Time required 

Key space:  allow all characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

Key length:  allow long strings

Time per attempt:  decreasing as computers get faster

**Encourage users to provide strong passwords**

**Slow password hashing algorithms**

**Timing and throttling**
  * configure firewall, server or app to slow down the rate at which requests
    can be received
  * 1 attempt per 2s
  * lock account for 5min after 20 attempts

**Logging**
  * don't log attempted password in plain text
  * "login was attempted"
  * "20 attempts from 160.54.49.32"

**Blacklisting**
  * ban an IP address from sending more requests
  * could be hundreds of botnets

Brute-force can't be stopped, but can be significantly slowed down.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Using SSL for login
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Secure Sockets Layer"

= Provides communication Security
  1. Verifies authenticity of remote server
  2. Encrypts all data exchanged with server

Communication between client and server passes through multiple hardware and
can easily be seen.

client to server:
```
username: son
password: goku
```
```
server to client:
```
Set-Cookie: SESSION_ID=A182C3D4E5 
```

Hardware closest to the client 'sees' both incoming and outcoming traffic 
- e.g. open Wi-Fi at coffe shop

Using SSL 

  * prevents snooping  (snoop = zabadati nos)

  * prevents session hijacking

  * performance penalty due to encryption/decryption - worth it

  * **requires all assets to be secure**
    * JS files, CSS files and images
    * loaded from 3rd party sources - e.g. analytics JS
    * else, users may get warnings that all parts of the page are not secure!

  * **You MUST encrypt**
    * all **credit card transations**
    * all **usernames/passwords sent to the server**

  * Best practice to **use SSL for password-protected areas**
    * from log in to log out
    * even if page contains no sensitive data, you are sending cookie 
      with authentication data

  * Implementations
    * **use SSL all the time** (GitHub)
    * switch it on when needed (Amazon)
    * user-configurable (Facebok)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Protection cookies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= after login, maintain authenticated access using cookies and sessions

Like a hand-stamp - we don't authenticate each time.
We take user's credentials, authenticate them, and give him a cookie.

* Use **HttpOnly cookies** - inaccessible to JS

* **Regenerate session identifier** periodically, at key points - **after login**
  * 'session fixation' attacks

* Expire/remove old sesion files regularly

* **Do not accept session identifiers from GET or POST variables**

* Use **SSL**

* Use **Secure cookies** - only sent over SSL 
  * Especially important if switching between HTTP and HTTPS

* Consider expiring logins after a set period of time
  * **set cookie expiration, remove session file**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Regulating acces privileges
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Least privileges** principle

Be organized

**Make privileges easy to revoke** - roles change and people leave organization

**Restrict access to access privilege administration tools** - 1 or 2 people

Be careful about getting to fine-grained

**Structure content into discrete *privilege areas* ** - don't let them overlap
```
Article { article content, article images, article categories, related articles }
Product { product details, product images, product catefories, related products }
Orders  { categories, tags, customers, orders }
```
editor = Article + product images
seller = customers + orders etc.

**Regulate access by user access level or category**

  * level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> can do anything

  * basic, staff, junior admin, admin, senior admin

  * publisher, writer, editor, designer, graphics

  * Paying customers - free, standard, VIP
